# gomokugame
This is a strategic game implementation known as "Gomoku," which is similar to tic-tac-toe but played on a larger board with the objective of getting five in a row. This project incorporates the use of the MiniMax algorithm and Alpha-Beta pruning, both of which are fundamental techniques in artificial intelligence and game theory.
